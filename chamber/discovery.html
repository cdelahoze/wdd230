                Facatativ√° has been characterized as one of the largest cities in Cundinamarca, 
                with a population of 147,177 inhabitants. Due to its altitude, 
                Facatativ√° has a Csbi mountain equatorial climate, 
                which has an average annual temperature of 13 ¬∞C. 
                However, it presents two ‚Äúfrost‚Äù seasons,

                During these two periods there is a temperature of up to 22 ¬∞C 
                during the day but at night an average temperature of 0 ¬∞C,

                  In the municipality of Facatativ√°, there is one of the greatest legacies that 
                  Colombians have of their indigenous past: the Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological 
                  Park, a place full of rock art, that is, images that have been engraved or 
                  painted on surfaces rocks by the Muisca community, as well as pictograms and 
                  remains of instruments of the oldest inhabitants of the Cundiboyacense savannah, 
                  such as hunter-gatherers. It is a majestic space of 27 hectares that many have 
                  not yet visited. Giant rocks in the shape of frogs, caves where indigenous 
                  rituals were performed, pictographs of hands, toads, and spirals are the 
                  attractions of this place that houses 12,000 years of history.</p>

                    According to scientific studies, it is known that in what is now the Archaeological Park, 
                    there was a large lake, with huge stones that were carved by the water current. 
                    In November 2021, the Piedras del Tunjo Archaeological Park, 
                    located in the municipality of Facatativ√°, reopened its doors to national and foreign tourists. 
                    In addition to its multiple myths, this archaeological park has a wide historical 
                    and heritage value due to the manifestations of primitive art that rest there, 
                    since they probably contain important messages to discover and learn about our true past, 
                    a fact that makes this area a treasure for humanity.</p>
