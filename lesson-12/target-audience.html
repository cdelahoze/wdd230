        <p>Maria Cristina, Alexander, and Numerlys were sealed in the
          Barranquilla Temple. They are now a family united for eternity under
          the covenant of holy matrimony. They live in Barranquilla but 
          celebrated their wedding in a hotel near the temple where they shared
          with relatives friends and family.</p>

          her parents. She lives with her parents in the City of Valledupar, 
          Department of Cesar, five hours from the Barranquilla Temple. Daniela 
          enjoys the Temple gardens very much, although she usually waits for 
          her parents in the service building next to the temple. When they 
          attend the Temple they stay at nearby member homes.</p>

        <img src="images/temple_person.webp"  alt= "person temple">

          there until they finish their mission for 2 years. They love to serve in 
          the temple.</p>
